**Optimizations:**

**Proposed Heuristics:**

Admissible/consistent heuristic: Manhattan Distance 
The manhattan distance is the safest option to calculate the heuristic value. If the value was overestimated, it would pose a problem in accuracy. Since it is counted block by block, the value will not be overestimated.  

Inadmissible heuristics: 
1. Euclidean Distance- Can be underestimated, but is still a good measurement.
2. Chebyshev distance- Provides a maximum distance 
3. Average of Euclidean and Manhattan Distance(?)
4. Average of Euclidean, Chebyshev, and Manhattan Distance

**Experimental Results:** 
(5-9)
